# PBC110-1_Overcooked

An easy version Overcook by pygame, with only 2 players and three kinds of ingredients. 

We added 'attack' function so that players do not actually cooperate but attack another when cooking, just to make it more exciting to play.

## Rules: ##
* Player in blue, press W,A,S,D for moving, C for taking ingredients (or dish), V for attack
* Player in purple, press Up,Down,Left,Right for moving, K for taking ingredients (or dish), L for attack

```
# Start by typing in Terminal:
python main.py
```

Enjoy!
