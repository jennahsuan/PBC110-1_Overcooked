# PBC110-1_Overcooked

An easy version Overcook by pygame, with only 2 players and three kinds of ingredients. 

We added 'attack' function so that players do not actually cooperate but attack another when cooking, just to make it more exciting to play.

## Rules: ##
* For player in blue, press W,A,S,D to move, C to pick up or put down ingredients and dishes, V to attack
* For player in purple, press Up,Down,Left,Right to move, K to pick up or put down ingredients and dishes, L for attack
* Follow the recipes to make edible dishes. 

```
# Start by typing in Terminal:
python main.py
```

Enjoy!
